## ðŸ“Œ Project Workflow: Tokyo Olympic Data Analytics (End-to-End Azure Data Engineering)

This project implements a modern **data engineering pipeline** on Azure to analyze Olympic data.  
The process is divided into **four key phases**:

---

### **Phase 1: Data Ingestion**
- **Source**: Olympic dataset (CSV, API, or database).
- **Tool Used**: **Azure Data Factory (ADF)**.
- **Process**:
  - ADF connects to the external source.
  - Extracts raw data and loads it into **Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2** (Raw Zone).

---

### **Phase 2: Raw Data Storage**
- **Tool Used**: **Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2**.
- **Process**:
  - Stores the ingested data in its original/raw format.
  - Acts as the **single source of truth** for downstream processing.
  - Enables reprocessing without fetching from the source again.

---

### **Phase 3: Data Transformation**
- **Tool Used**: **Azure Databricks** (Apache Spark-based).
- **Process**:
  - Reads raw data from Data Lake.
  - Applies transformation logic (cleaning, joining, aggregations, schema standardization).
  - Writes the **business-ready datasets** back into Data Lake (Curated/Transformed Zone).

---

### **Phase 4: Analytics & Reporting**
- **Tool Used**: **Azure Synapse Analytics**.
- **Process**:
  - Connects to the transformed data in Data Lake.
  - Provides a powerful SQL-based analytics environment.
  - Models and queries data to extract insights.
  - Can be further connected to **Power BI** for dashboards and visualizations.
